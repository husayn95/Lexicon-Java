    /* rite a method named sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number.

    The method needs to find the first and the last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop
    and return the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.

    If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

    Example input/output

* sumFirstAndLastDigit(252); → should return 4, the first digit is 2 and the last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the sum is 4.

            * sumFirstAndLastDigit(257); → should return 9, the first digit is 2 and the last is 7 which gives us 2+7 and the sum is 9.

            * sumFirstAndLastDigit(0); → should return 0, the first digit and the last digit is 0 since we only have 1 digit, which gives us 0+0 and the sum is 0.

            * sumFirstAndLastDigit(5); → should return 10, the first digit and the last digit is 5 since we only have 1 digit, which gives us 5+5 and the sum is 10.

            * sumFirstAndLastDigit(-10); → should return -1, since the parameter is negative and needs to be positive.


    NOTE: The method sumFirstAndLastDigit needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

    NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code. */

    public static int FirstLastDigitSum(int number) {
        // write your code here
        //int number;
        if (number < 0){
            return -1;
        }


        int firstDigit = number;
        int lastDigit = number % 10;



        while ( firstDigit >= 10 )
            firstDigit /= 10;
            int sum = firstDigit + lastDigit;
            return sum;
